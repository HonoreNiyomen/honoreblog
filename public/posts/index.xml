      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why do phones really have to be these stressing. from the time i moved on from the S20, i haven&amp;rsquo;t touched a single good phone. been trying to get one only ending up in dead ends. hopefully this weekend, one will be found and this long race will come to an end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And bit inspiration from NetworkChuck, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have started this journey now if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for him starting his.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
